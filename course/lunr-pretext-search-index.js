Identifies the three phases of such an application and develops skills necessary to carry out each step: a) translation of the given physical information into a mathematical model; b) treatment of the model by mathematical methods; c) interpretation of the mathematical result in physical terms. Investigates topics including vector analysis, Taylor and Fourier series, partial differential equations and their applications.

The policy for this course is that students taking MATH 342 take responsibility for their own learning and regularly attend class. There will be occasional in-class activities completed and submitted in class. These activities are a graded part of the class, and you must be present to earn the points.    Late work  For Homework, the late submission is allowed with 25% penalty per day. For In-class Activities and Quizzes, the make-up is allowed for individual work but it must be done before the next class period. No make-up is allowed for group work. For exams, you must contact the instructor (via: email: yjkuo@iup.edu) within 24 hours of missing an exam and be prepared to provide documentation. Makeups are given at the discretion of the instructor and only in the case of verified medical or other documented emergencies.    Academic Integrity  All students are required to abide by the University Policy on Academic Integrity. YOU MUST DO ALL YOUR OWN WORK. See: and the section on Academic Policies and Academic Integrity: Indiana University of Pennsylvania is committed to the fundamental values of academic integrity. Academic integrity means honesty and responsibility in scholarly endeavors and behaviors; it means that all academic work should be the result of an individual's own effort. Academic assignments help students learn and allow them to exhibit this earning. Grades are an assessment of the extent to which learning has been demonstrated in assignments. Therefore, academic work and grades should be the result of a student’s own understanding and effort. All members of the IUP community-including students, faculty, and staff-are responsible for maintaining academic integrity, which includes knowing what IUP's academic integrity policies are and being able to identify academic misconduct. Academic misconduct includes any action which improperly impacts the assessment or representation of a student's academic achievement. Academic misconduct may result in disciplinary action, including expulsion from the University. Students who do not do their own work can be subject to penalty, including but not limited to zero grades on affected assignments and\/or referral to the University for academic integrity violations.    Department of Disability Advising and Access (D2A2)  Indiana University of Pennsylvania provides reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities who have self-identified and been approved by the Department for Disability Access and Advising (D2A2). If you have any kind of disability, whether apparent or non-apparent, learning, emotional, physical, or cognitive, chronic or short-term, please make an appointment to meet with me as soon as possible in order to discuss your accommodations and your access needs. All discussions will remain confidential. You must be registered with the Department for Disability Access and Advising (D2A2), and requested them to provide your accommodation letter to me, before I can accommodate you. If you have not yet contacted D2A2, and would like to request accommodations or have questions, you can make an appointment by emailing (preferred) D2A2 at or by calling 724-357-4067. The office is located in Pratt Hall, Room 216, 201 Pratt Drive. All services are confidential.    Title IX  Indiana University of Pennsylvania and its faculty are committed to assuring a safe and productive educational environment for all students. In order to meet this commitment and to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and guidance from the Office for Civil Rights, the University requires faculty members to report incidents of sexual violence shared by students to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The only exceptions to the faculty member's reporting obligation are when incidents of sexual violence are communicated by a student during a classroom discussion, in a writing assignment for a class, or as part of a University-approved research project. Faculty members are obligated to report sexual violence or any other abuse of a student who was, or is, a child (a person under 18 years of age) when the abuse allegedly occurred to the Department of Human Services (1-800-932-0313) and University Police (724-357-2141). Information regarding the reporting of sexual violence and the resources that are available to victims of sexual violence is set forth at:     "
